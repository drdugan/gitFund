$git branch feature1
$git checkout feature1
//i added a file called feature1.txt when I commit the file the feature one branch moves up to the next commit
//So does HEAD
//because the change was made on that branch.
//branches are labels for commits shas and move with changes
//tags stay in place

//checkout a branch
git checkout master

//now that the change is on that branch if I switch back to the origin branch and do a git log
//HEAD will be back down at the previous commit before the branch and won't include the change made in feature1 branch

//rename a branch
git branch -m oldname newname
